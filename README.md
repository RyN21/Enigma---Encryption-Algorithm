# Enigma---Encryption-Algorithm

I think overall, I did pretty well on this project. I tried to break everyhting down simply and work at it one step at a time. Everything ended up working the way it was intended to. I tried to keep the code clean and give the methods and classes sinlge responsibilities. It was a project I really enjoyed doing.
